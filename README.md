# JCU CP3408 Engine Simulation Final Assignment using Unity

##Participants
Richard Willianto, Julian Evan, and Andres Garcia's 

##Description
This is a Top Down 2D shooter with sneaking elements. This was coded using C# and the Unity Engine. The basic functions are that the player has to sneak through the level without being spotted. The enemies are accurate and the game is very unforgiving to add a difficulty to the game. The game ends once the player explores and collects an objective in one of three designated and randomized rooms. 

##Skills Learned
Throughout this project our group learned to work collaboratively using only online methods. We assigned tasks at the beginning of the assignment and organizing each of the steps that we were going to undertake using Trello. We also learned to use new means of communication such as Zoom to have meetings and discuss our progress. 

We learned to use alternative methods when our most common means of doing tasks are compromised. We also learned to use C# more confidently as well as the process that is undergone to plan and develop a video game.
